# Daswos Robot Image Analysis

## Overview of New Robot Design

The new Daswos robot images show a significantly more detailed and refined design compared to the previous simplified version. The robot maintains the same color scheme (blue, white, black) but with much more sophisticated details and proportions.

## Key Design Elements

### Head (Blue Sphere)
- Large blue spherical head with a smooth, matte finish
- Black visor/screen area on the front with two blue oval eyes visible
- The visor is rounded rectangular in shape and recessed into the blue sphere
- In the side view, the visor appears as a slit on the side of the head

### Body (White Sphere)
- White spherical/rounded body that serves as the main torso
- Slightly smaller than the head but with a similar smooth finish
- Connected to the head with a small black connector/neck piece
- In some views (front, three-quarter), the body has small white feet at the bottom

### Arms (Black)
- Smooth, rounded black arms that extend from the sides of the white body
- Arms are simple, slightly curved cylinders with rounded ends
- No visible hands or fingers, just the smooth rounded arm extensions
- Arms appear to be fixed to the body rather than having complex articulation

### Feet (White)
- Small, rounded white feet visible in the front and three-quarter views
- Appear to be part of the white body structure rather than separate components
- Give the robot a stable standing position when not rolling

## View-Specific Details

### Front View
- Full face with visor and eyes clearly visible
- Arms extending outward from both sides
- Feet visible at the bottom
- Perfect for "talking" and "greeting" animations

### Side View
- Profile showing the head with side visor slit
- Single arm visible extending from the body
- No feet visible as the body appears more wheel-like from this angle
- Ideal for "rolling" animations

### Three-Quarter View
- Angled perspective showing partial face and visor
- Both arms visible but at different depths
- Feet visible at the bottom
- Good for "turning" and transitional animations

### Back View
- Solid blue head with no visor visible
- Arms extending outward from both sides
- Feet visible at the bottom
- Useful for "walking away" or "searching" animations

### Top View
- Looking down on the blue head
- Arms extending outward from the white body
- No visor visible from this angle
- Could be used for "looking down" or special perspective animations

## Animation Considerations

1. **Head Rotation**: The head appears to be able to rotate on the body, which should be maintained in the animation

2. **Screen/Visor**: The visor with eyes can be animated to show different expressions or states

3. **Rolling vs. Walking**: The robot can either roll (using the body as a wheel) or walk on its feet depending on the animation state

4. **Arm Movement**: The arms should have subtle movements to enhance expressiveness

5. **Perspective Switching**: The animation will need to switch between different image views based on the robot's orientation and action
